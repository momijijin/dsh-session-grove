# Archive pointer

The repository no longer carries the full historical process/design documents.
On 2026-11-05 they were moved to a local maintainer archive outside Git:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\Projects\dsh-session-groups-archive-20261105-160722
%USERPROFILE%\Projects\dsh-session-groups-archive-superpowers-20261105-2344
```

Archived content includes:

```text
TEST-PLAN.md
V1-PLAN.md
GATE0-SUMMARY.md
SPIKE.md
superpowers/plans/
superpowers/specs/
```

Why: active docs had grown to duplicate current behavior, tests and contracts.
Historical rationale is preserved externally; day-to-day docs should point to
the current source of truth instead.

Current documentation starts at [../INDEX.md](../INDEX.md):

- test matrix: [../TEST-MATRIX.md](../TEST-MATRIX.md)
- architecture: [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- compatibility: [../COMPATIBILITY.md](../COMPATIBILITY.md)
- localization: [../I18N.md](../I18N.md)

Do not treat any external archived file as current behavior.
